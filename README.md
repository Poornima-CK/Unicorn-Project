# Unicorn-Project

The online sector has been slowly eating up market share in the past two decades. E-commerce platforms like Unicorn allow people to buy products online: from books, toys, clothes, and shoes to food, furniture, and other household items.

The following dataset includes Unicorn sales data from the years 2015-2018.

The task is to analyze the data, find interesting insights, and identify weak areas and opportunities for Unicorn to boost its business growth

The project includes 4 main parts, each with their subtasks:

      ● Data Exploration by SQL
  
      ● Data Cleaning using Spreadsheets
  
      ● Getting Insights using Tableau
  
      ● Executive summary and presentation


The project consists of:

**Dashboard 1:** Explaining all yearly KPI values and comparisons.

      ● Sales

      ● Profit

      ● Number of Orders

      ● State wise Profit

**Dashboard 2 & 3:** Presenting the Business Problem: “Reason for Fall of Profit throughout the years from
2017 to 2018 while the number of Orders is growing”.

**Prediction:**

      ● The UNICORN profit growth rate as percentage increased enormously from 2015 to 2016.
      However, that trend was not maintained in the subsequent years i.e. the profit growth rate was 
      stagnant between 2016 and 2017, and even went down in 2018. However, the number of ordered
      items increased linearly in the same period. Some Machine data can be an outlier.

      ● High discounts mostly starting from 50% to 80% on the products of Furniture, Office Supplies leads to 
      negative profit. Data shows discount and profit inversely proportional in 2018.

**Assumptions:**

As data belongs to the USA so the currency is USD $. After going through data in DB and csv,
data is already cleaned. However there were some outliers in the profit column for some products.

**Missing Information:**

No data given for delayed shipment or returned orders. 4 Missing Orders in CSV hence
details are also not present

**Recommendation:**

After thorough analysis as explained in Dashboard we recommend to:

      ● Revise policy of discounts for products of subcategories
  
          ○ ‘Machines’ 
          
          ○ ‘Binders’ 
          
          ○ ‘Tables’
    
      ● We should focus on Technology products of Sub Category
  
          ○ ‘Phones’ 
          
          ○ ‘Accessories’
